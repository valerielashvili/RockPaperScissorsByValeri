# The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" Game
A console based Python implementation of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.

[Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/valerielashvili/RockPaperScissorsByValeri/blob/main/rock-paper-scissors.py) 
is a **two player game**, where each player makes a throw simultaneously, choosing either **rock**, **paper**, 
or **scissors** to determine the winner based on the game's rules:
- **Rock** crushes scissors.
- **Scissors** cuts paper.
- **Paper** covers rock.

The **winner** is determined by the player's choice which beats the choice of his opponent. If both players make the same
throw (e.g. rock), the game outcome is **draw**.

This basic implementation of the cherished game is an extra project in the [Data Types and Variables](https://softuni.bg/trainings/5092/programming-fundamentals-with-python-september-2025#lesson-96021) 
lesson which is part of the **Programming Fundamentals with Python** module from [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/),
description of the practical exercise can be found [here](https://softuni.bg/downloads/svn/soft-tech/Sept-2025/Python/02-Data-Types-and-Variables/01-Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors/01-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project-Description..pdf). The goal of the project is to better learn Python and work with Git & GitHub.
